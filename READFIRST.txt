Electron x React. 
Electron is a framework for creating native applications with web technologies like JavaScript,
Html and Css. Together with React, 
React is an open-source library for building user interfaces(UIs). I used these two for building
this desktop app.

if u want to download the code, make sure to run this in ur terminal
NPM INSTALL or NPM I, works with lowercase too just to emphasize.
This will create NODE_MODULES folder to ur root directory 
where npm saves all packages that ur program needs to run the app.
